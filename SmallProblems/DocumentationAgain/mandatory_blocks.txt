Some methods require a block as a parameter. 

#bsearch takes a block as a parameter. If no block is given, it returns an 
enumerator. The block passed should have all falses first, then all trues.
For example, x == 7 is a bad operand to pass into the block because there could
be falses, a true, then more falses. 

If a logical operation is passed into the block, bsearch returns the first member
of the array that passes the operation. 

a.bsearch { |x| x > 8 }
=> 11
