Ruby allows a sort of multiple inheritance through mixin using its modules. A class
can include another, gaining access to the new classes methods. The module can 
require a method definition in the main class. Mixins generall, and modules 
specifically, are similar to interfaces. The main difference is that mixins 
can't check if an object includes the module like you can check if a class
implements an interface.

#min is not an array method. It's documentation can be found in the included
enumerable module. 

puts a.min(2)
