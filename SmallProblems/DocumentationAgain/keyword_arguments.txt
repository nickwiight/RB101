Some methods take keyword arguements (or named arguments). Keyword arguement names
are symbols. The keyword must be included when calling the method. The order of 
keyword arguments is not mandatory.

#step starts from self, evaluates the block, then adds by, until the result is 
greater than to. Does not evaluate the last step. Returns an array.

prints:
5
8
