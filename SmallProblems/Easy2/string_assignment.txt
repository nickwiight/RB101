The first block of code prints Alice, then Bob because name was reassigned, sending
its value to a new place in memory.

In the second block of code, both name and save_name print BOB because upcase changes
the data in memory of name, which save_name is also pointing to. Since save_name
is pointing to the same spot in memory, its value is also changed.
