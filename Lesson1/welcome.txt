The Discussion forum is for questions about the current lesson. The General Forum
is for non-lesson specific conversations and questions. 

Reinforce the Slack habit. Check Slack regularly. #the-spot is where study groups
are formed. Slack is the defacto work communication platform, so getting used to
it will help. 

Get good feedback by asking specific questions that fully explain the issue, the
attempted solutions, and show any code and errors needed. The easier it is for
someone to get to the core question and answer needed for me, the faster someone
will answer. Use Rubber Duck debugging.

Use one Github repository for each course. Use folders for each lesson. Each exercise
should be its own file.

Ask questions, but also answer questions if I know the answer. Try to make learning
at Launch School collaberative.
