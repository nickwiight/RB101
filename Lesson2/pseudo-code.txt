# sum of two integers
Given two numbers, set their sum to a variable named result.
Print result.

START
Given two integers

SET result = Integer1 + Integer2

PRINT result
END


# combine array of strings to one string
Given an array of strings, create a variable named result. Loop over every
index of the array and concat them to result. Print result

START
Given an array of strings named strings

SET result = ''

WHILE i < strings' length
	result concat array[i]

PRINT result
END


# every other element of an array
Given an array, create an empty array named result. Loop over every index of the
given array and push it to result if its index is even.

START
Given an array named array.

SET result = []

while i < array's length
	if i is even
		result.push array[i]

PRINT result
END


# return the index of the third occurrence of a character in a string
Given a string named string, create a variable named count. Loop over every character
in string. If the character is the needed character, increase count by 1. If count
is 3, print the index.

START
Given an string named string and a character named character

SET count = 0

WHILE i < string.length
	if string[i] == character
		count += 1
	if count == 3
		PRINT i
END


# merge two arrays
Given two arrays, named arr1 and arr2. Create a new array variable named result.
Loop over arr1. Push arr1[i], then arr2[i] to result. Print result

START
Given two arrays, arr1 and arr2

SET result = []

while i < arr1.length
	result.push(arr1[i])
	result.push(arr2[i])

PRINT result
END
